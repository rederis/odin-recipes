    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic, easy-to-make Margherita pizza with a crispy, golden crust, topped with fresh mozzarella, tangy tomato
        sauce, and fragrant basil leaves. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a casual gathering.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (preferably pizza sauce or crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>8 oz fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (about 6-8)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat
            up as
            well.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness (about 12 inches
            for
            a medium pizza). Transfer to a parchment paper if using a pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Add Sauce: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for
            the
            crust.</li>
        <li>Top with Cheese: Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake the Pizza: Transfer the pizza to the oven (on the stone or a baking sheet) and bake for 10-12 minutes,
            or
            until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Finish with Basil and Olive Oil: Once out of the oven, scatter fresh basil leaves over the top, and drizzle
            with
            a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Slice and Serve: Slice the pizza and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
